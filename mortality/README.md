# Studying sepsis by modelling patient mortality

## Aim

## Methodology

### Data used in this analysis

The in-house data at Alfred Health and the MIMIC III data both represented in OMOP schema will be used for this analysis. As it is a multi-centre study, usage of OMOP is preferred to make the analysis interoperable. It will also help in validating the models built on MIMIC schema on in-house Alfred data and vice versa.
